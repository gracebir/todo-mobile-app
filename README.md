# React Native Todo Application

## Overview

This is a simple Todo application built using React Native and Expo. The project is structured based on the Expo tabs template, providing a convenient folder structure.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **User Authentication:** Log in and log out functionality.
- **Backend API Integration:** Communicates with a backend API to store and retrieve tasks.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows the Expo tabs template:

- **assets:** Contains static assets such as images and icons.
- **components:** Reusable UI components used throughout the application.
- **screens:** Screen components for different sections of the application (e.g., Home, Profile, etc.).
- **slices:** Redux Toolkit slices for managing application state.
- **utils:** Utility functions and helper modules.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gracebir/todo-mobile-app

    ```

3. Install dependencies:
